					<p style="border:5px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FFFFFF; padding: 1em;">To revitalize the economy, I will focus on regional needs, take certain steps and implement community economic rejuvenation 
					   policies - that are similar to those implemented for the prosperity of this nation after the civil war. Now, let's talk, "economy, the American way" The American civil war showed us how important small 
					   businesses are to the growth of this nation. These small businesses are the back bone of many local regions. They create varieties of jobs in our local comunities. They don't have exotic tastes, so no 
					   need to ship jobs abroad, talk less of outsourcing services. Small businesses, manufacturers and service providers could help stimulate economic recovery in areas with high unemployment rate. With this 
					   in mind, i'd rather give tax breaks to small businesses, inovators and the middle class, than swell big corporations...</p>  
					<p style="color:#DCDCDC">Follow me @The46th_POTUS</p> 
					<p style="border:5px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FFFFFF; padding: 1em;">For the West Coast states - California, Washington, Oregon, Utah and Nevada, I will:
					   treat these areas as the frontline of the future of our defense. And I will do three major things for them. First in the area of defense. Second is technology. And third is waterfarming. But let's talk 
					   about the first and the last.
					   Defense: Long endurance weapons, aerial/spectrum denial platforms and different types sub-surface weapons with passive anti-buoyancy capability are the biggest threat to the American homeland now. And 
					   they are in the hands of aliies and foes in the Pacific. To counter these I propose a review of our current doctrine. Make way fro a deep defense structure by reshuffling our offensive posture. I also 
					   propose a new military, a new mindset and a totally new doctrine. We need newly conceived weapons, new weapon platforms and new technology to face this type of challenge. All we have as at know are 
					   Reagan-era weapons. They are good for defending Europe and the Middle East. But are they good in the Pacific, No? Are they good for the homeland, No?.</p>
